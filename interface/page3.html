The day you realize your rewards in USD is what you should input as your end date.<br></br>  Accounting for your rewards using a cash basis is possible because staking rewards are not dividends or a 'realized gain upon receipt' asset. Rewards are owned by a staker because they created them and they are only taxable upon the realization of their value in a fiat currency. This justifies accounting over a cash basis, similar to a business that calcualtes the cash basis of bread baking equipment, the hardware for generating staking rewards off a blockchain is cryptocurrency capital.<br></br>  An additional accounting inefficiency is that realized staking reward income does not account for cryptocurrency dilution. Dilution of cyrptocurrency is a naturally occuring phenomena due to the expansion of the overall supply of a currency in a blockchain network. The expansion occurs every time staking rewards are generated. In PoW (Proof of Work) systems, like Bitcoin, this event is equivalent to 'mining'. The rate of the expansion proportionitly dilutes reward income.  <br></br> Without accounting over a basis and accounting for dilution, your economic gain from staking is overstated, and your income will be overtaxed. <br></br> PoS Tax accounts for your rewards over a cash basis and accounts for your rewards using two dilution phenomenas.
